            <h2>Free speed reading courses</h2>
            <p>
            If you do not have the money to invest on a <strong>speed reading course</strong> or dedicated <strong>speed reading program</strong>, the Internet is a great place to find lots of free speed reading resources which you may find useful to developing this invaluable skill.  Resources like this website can provide you with a start and the main benefit of free courses are that well... they are free!
            </p>
            
            <p>
            With most free resources, the emphasis is on you and your motivation to self-learn this skill.  Particularly as there will not be a financial attachment to seeing it through.  So in short, if you do not have the drive and discipline to self-teach this skill, then you may not get much from a free speed reading course as you perhaps may do from a paid program.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Here are some free speed reading courses which you can get started with right now:
            </p>
            
            <p>
            <a href="http://www.mrkent.com/speedread/index.asp" target="_blank">MrKent's Free Speed Reading course</a>.
            Short and to-the-point speed reading method. You won't get much of an advance here, but it is a great starting point in free speed reading.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            The <a href="http://www.studyhall.com/sread.htm" target="_blank">Study Hall free Speed Reading Programs</a>.
            Strangely difficult to read due to its intense bold font but comes with a plan to help you track your speed reading efforts.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            <a href="http://www.magicspeedreading.com/words/slowly_reading.html" target="_blank">Magic speed reading</a>.
            This simple program acts as an also simple training exercises for speed reading.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            All of these free resources are fine but you could be missing out of better paid programs.  Deciding to develop your reading speed and comprehension can be a great investment in what could be a life-long skill.  Here at myReadSpeed we do not endorse any particular program but the reason we believe it may be worthwhile investing the money if you have it, is that a commercial speed reading program often has more resources and interests to bring together better exercises, techniques and in explaining the process in a much better way.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Free speed reading courses are a great starting point and quite possibly be all that you need to dramatically increase your reading speed to a level which you are happy with, but if you have the money, it may be worth taking a look at commercial reading courses and investing in improving your skill if you feel it would significantly help your worklife or personal lifestyle.
