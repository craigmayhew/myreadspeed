            <p>YOU don't know about me without you have read a book by the name of TheAdventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain't no matter.  That book was madeby Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly.  There was things whichhe stretched, but mainly he told the truth.  That is nothing.  I neverseen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt Polly, orthe widow, or maybe Mary.  Aunt Polly--Tom's Aunt Polly, she is--andMary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book, which ismostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said before.</p><p>Now the way that the book winds up is this:  Tom and me found the moneythat the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich.  We got sixthousand dollars apiece--all gold.  It was an awful sight of money whenit was piled up.  Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out atinterest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year round--more than a body could tell what to do with.  The Widow Douglas she tookme for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was roughliving in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular anddecent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn't stand it nolonger I lit out.  I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead again,and was free and satisfied.  But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and said hewas going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I would go backto the widow and be respectable.  So I went back.</p><p>The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and shecalled me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by it.She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn't do nothing but sweatand sweat, and feel all cramped up.  Well, then, the old thing commencedagain.  The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to come to time.When you got to the table you couldn't go right to eating, but you had towait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little over thevictuals, though there warn't really anything the matter with them,--thatis, nothing only everything was cooked by itself.  In a barrel of oddsand ends it is different; things get mixed up, and the juice kind ofswaps around, and the things go better.</p><p>After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and theBulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by and byshe let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; so thenI didn't care no more about him, because I don't take no stock in deadpeople.</p><p>Pretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me.  But shewouldn't.  She said it was a mean practice and wasn't clean, and I musttry to not do it any more.  That is just the way with some people.  Theyget down on a thing when they don't know nothing about it.  Here she wasa-bothering about Moses, which was no kin to her, and no use to anybody,being gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault with me for doing athing that had some good in it.  And she took snuff, too; of course thatwas all right, because she done it herself.</p>            </div>
