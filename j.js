That book was madeby Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly.  There was things whichhe stretched, but mainly he told the truth.  That is nothing.  I neverseen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt Polly, orthe widow, or maybe Mary.  Aunt Polly--Tom's Aunt Polly, she is--andMary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book, which ismostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said before.</p><p>Now the way that the book winds up is this:  Tom and me found the moneythat the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich.  We got sixthousand dollars apiece--all gold.  It was an awful sight of money whenit was piled up.  Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out atinterest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year round--more than a body could tell what to do with.  The Widow Douglas she tookme for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was roughliving in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular anddecent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn't stand it nolonger I lit out.  I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead again,and was free and satisfied.  But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and said hewas going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I would go backto the widow and be respectable.  So I went back.</p><p>The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and shecalled me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by it.She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn't do nothing but sweatand sweat, and feel all cramped up.  Well, then, the old thing commencedagain.  The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to come to time.When you got to the table you couldn't go right to eating, but you had towait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little over thevictuals, though there warn't really anything the matter with them,--thatis, nothing only everything was cooked by itself.  In a barrel of oddsand ends it is different; things get mixed up, and the juice kind ofswaps around, and the things go better.</p><p>After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and theBulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by and byshe let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; so thenI didn't care no more about him, because I don't take no stock in deadpeople.</p><p>Pretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me.  But shewouldn't.  She said it was a mean practice and wasn't clean, and I musttry to not do it any more.  That is just the way with some people.  Theyget down on a thing when they don't know nothing about it.  Here she wasa-bothering about Moses, which was no kin to her, and no use to anybody,being gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault with me for doing athing that had some good in it.  And she took snuff, too; of course thatwas all right, because she done it herself.</p>"},

Her mother haddied too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembranceof her caresses; and her place had been supplied by an excellent womanas governess, who had fallen little short of a mother in affection.</p><p>Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse's family, less as agoverness than a friend, very fond of both daughters, but particularlyof Emma.  Between _them_ it was more the intimacy of sisters.  Evenbefore Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess,the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose anyrestraint; and the shadow of authority being now long passed away, theyhad been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached,and Emma doing just what she liked; highly esteeming Miss Taylor'sjudgment, but directed chiefly by her own.</p><p>The real evils, indeed, of Emma's situation were the power of havingrather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little toowell of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy toher many enjoyments.

Her father composed himself to sleep afterdinner, as usual, and she had then only to sit and think of what shehad lost.</p><p>The event had every promise of happiness for her friend.

Sherecalled her past kindness--the kindness, the affection of sixteenyears--how she had taught and how she had played with her from fiveyears old--how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse herin health--and how nursed her through the various illnesses ofchildhood.  A large debt of gratitude was owing here; but theintercourse of the last seven years, the equal footing and perfectunreserve which had soon followed Isabella's marriage, on their beingleft to each other, was yet a dearer, tenderer recollection.  She hadbeen a friend and companion such as few possessed: intelligent,well-informed, useful, gentle, knowing all the ways of the family,interested in all its concerns, and peculiarly interested in herself,in every pleasure, every scheme of hers--one to whom she could speakevery thought as it arose, and who had such an affection for her ascould never find fault.</p><p>How was she to bear the change?--It was true that her friend was goingonly half a mile from them; but Emma was aware that great must be thedifference between a Mrs. Weston, only half a mile from them, and aMiss Taylor in the house; and with all her advantages, natural anddomestic, she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectualsolitude.

There--for with your leave, my sister, I will putsome trust in preceding navigators--there snow and frost are banished;and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing inwonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitableglobe.  Its productions and features may be without example, as thephenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscoveredsolitudes.  What may not be expected in a country of eternal light?

Ihave read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which havebeen made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Oceanthrough the seas which surround the pole.  You may remember that ahistory of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed thewhole of our good Uncle Thomas' library.  My education was neglected,yet I was passionately fond of reading.

She resurrected nothing but the cat.</p><p>\"I never did see the beat of that boy!\"</p><p>She went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among thetomato vines and \"jimpson\" weeds that constituted the garden. No Tom.So she lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for distance andshouted:</p><p>\"Y-o-u-u TOM!\"</p><p>There was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time toseize a small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight.</p><p>\"There! I might 'a' thought of that closet. What you been doing inthere?\"</p><p>\"Nothing.\"</p><p>\"Nothing! Look at your hands. And look at your mouth. What IS thattruck?\"</p><p>\"I don't know, aunt.\"</p><p>\"Well, I know. It's jam--that's what it is. Forty times I've said ifyou didn't let that jam alone I'd skin you. Hand me that switch.\"</p><p>The switch hovered in the air--the peril was desperate--</p><p>\"My! Look behind you, aunt!\"</p><p>The old lady whirled round, and snatched her skirts out of danger. Thelad fled on the instant, scrambled up the high board-fence, anddisappeared over it.</p><p>His aunt Polly stood surprised a moment, and then broke into a gentlelaugh.</p><p>\"Hang the boy, can't I never learn anything? Ain't he played me tricksenough like that for me to be looking out for him by this time? But oldfools is the biggest fools there is. Can't learn an old dog new tricks,as the saying is. But my goodness, he never plays them alike, two days,and how is a body to know what's coming? He 'pears to know just howlong he can torment me before I get my dander up, and he knows if hecan make out to put me off for a minute or make me laugh, it's all downagain and I can't hit him a lick. I ain't doing my duty by that boy,and that's the Lord's truth, goodness knows. Spare the rod and spilethe child, as the Good Book says. I'm a laying up sin and suffering forus both, I know. He's full of the Old Scratch, but laws-a-me! he's myown dead sister's boy, poor thing, and I ain't got the heart to lashhim, somehow. Every time I let him off, my conscience does hurt me so,and every time I hit him my old heart most breaks. Well-a-well, manthat is born of woman is of few days and full of trouble, as theScripture says, and I reckon it's so. He'll play hookey this evening, *and [* Southwestern for \"afternoon\"] I'll just be obleeged to make himwork, to-morrow, to punish him. It's mighty hard to make him workSaturdays, when all the boys is having holiday, but he hates work morethan he hates anything else, and I've GOT to do some of my duty by him,or I'll be the ruination of the child.\"</p>"}
